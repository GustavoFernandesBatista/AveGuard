I created an application that tells the story of a bird that is in danger of extinction. Through the application, the user can follow the bird's journey and learn about the dangers it faces. However, the application doesn't stop there - I wanted to create a way to raise awareness about endangered birds and promote conservation efforts. That's why I came up with the idea of using the camera feature and CoreML to help identify endangered birds in Brazil. Every time a user takes a photo of a bird, the application analyzes the image and determines whether the bird is in danger of extinction or not. If the bird is endangered, the application returns an image that indicates danger. If the bird is not endangered, the application returns an image that shows the bird is safe. This way, the user can learn about the birds that need protection and take action to help preserve them.
